package Banking;
//Requirements for the Bank Account System
//Objective:
//
//Design a Bank Account system that allows users to perform basic transactions
// such as depositing, withdrawing, and checking their balance.
//
//Functional Requirements:
//
//    Create a bank account with an initial balance.
//        Users should specify an opening balance when creating an account.
//
//    Deposit money into the account.
//        Users should be able to increase their balance by depositing a positive amount.
//
//    Withdraw money from the account.
//        Users should be able to withdraw money if the account has sufficient funds.
//        If the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance, an insufficient funds warning should be displayed.
//
//    Display the current account balance.
//        The system should show the updated balance after eachÂ transaction.
